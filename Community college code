I was a part of the robotics team in college as well.
My responsibilities were the same, but there were less people to work with with members coming and going.

Let me explain in more detail one of the driving features for a robot.
One driving format, which worked well with the design of the robots, was the tank control format.

Essentially, the left stick controlled the motors on the left side of the robot, and the right for the motors on the right.
Buttons were reserved for additional motors used to control what I would call "appendages" (Motor(s) involved with parts such as nets, claws, arms).

Built-in funtions allowed me to program motors with variable speeds, which allowed for precise control of a robot.

The other format is similar to most racing games.
Left stick is for "steering", it made the whole robot rotate in place clockwise or counterclockwise.
Right stick would vary on the additional features of a robot. For example, arms that go up and down.
Shoulder buttons would be for reversing or going forward.
