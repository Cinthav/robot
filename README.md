# About this Repository: Vex Robotics Showcase

Welcome to the Vex Robotics repository, where I am thrilled to present the code that I developed in collaboration with the engineers of Garfield High School's team 154D, alongside other teams who provided valuable assistance.

While I am proud of the work showcased here, I want to emphasize that I will promptly remove any files if I am prevented or prohibited from sharing them.

The C files in the repository is a snapshot of the programs for two years and two different robots. Many iterations were made, but these files are good representations of the final products and highlight the main features of the robots.

During my involvement with this project, I had the invaluable opportunity to work in a team environment, honing my skills in collaborative coding. It marked my first experience developing code with client specifications in mind, extending beyond class assignments and small-scale projects. The challenge of meeting the driver and engineer's requirements while ensuring reliability and consistency in the robot's code was both exciting and fulfilling.

Notably, I had the privilege of working directly with the robot itself, gaining intimate knowledge of its various components. This hands-on experience greatly contributed to my understanding of the code's practical implementation.

My primary responsibilities revolved around programming the controller buttons and implementing autonomous movement for the robot during matches. I navigated the complexities of time restrictions, driver preferences for the controller, and the inherent limitations of the robot's capabilities.

My experience with NOVA's Vex robotics team was also remarkable, with similar responsibilities to those I had during high school. However, this time, we transitioned to V5, which introduced a new operating system, IDE, and language. I utilized Vex Coding Studio (VCS), which supported C++. As I reflect on the programs now, I notice striking similarities to C programs, likely due to the close relationship between C and C++. Elements such as file structures and Makefiles demonstrate this connection.

While I would like to share the code from this period, I cannot claim ownership or permission to distribute it. To obtain further information, I kindly request that you reach out to the manager of Northern Virginia Community College's robotics team and inquire about the Woodbridge team from 2020.
