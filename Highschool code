During my junior and senior years in highschool, I was an active member of the school's robotics team (One of several in fact).
I was one of the few programmers for the robot.
Since VEX went through a change with their own programming langauge + environment at the time, I dealt with different syntax.

Most of the work that programmers were responsible for during a season was maintenace and refactoring code as the design of robots would
tend to change. Since I was also working with the engineers to assemble the robots, I was familiar with the different components that needed
to be programmed the most.

This includes: considering the needs of a pilot of a robot in order to make the experience with the controls seemless, and constantly adjusting the
code for the autonomous feature of the robot.

Let me describe one of the features that I was responsible for: user input from a controller connected to the robot.
Before V5, there was click-and-drag code.
When VEX updated to V5, it went mostly text-based. However, they provided many useful functions which allowed bgeinners to easily program a robot. 

Using the tools available, I implemented code which allowed for variable speeds and 

One of the things I wish I could have learned at the time is how to program sensors, which would have made the autonomous feature of the robot
exponentially better (Allowing the robot to detect when there was a target, wall, obstacle, etc.). 
Instead, we relied on predetermined values as a result of trial-and-error with measuring the dimensions of the field
and keeping record of the obstacles on the field.
